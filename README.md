# Lok Sabha Elections 2024 — Data Analysis & Visualization 🗳️

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a data-driven analysis of the **2024 Indian General Elections (Lok Sabha)** using **SQL** and **Power BI**. The analysis focuses on constituency-level results, alliance-wise seat distribution, vote margins, and state-wise performance of major political parties and alliances — specifically **NDA**, **I.N.D.I.A**, and Others.

The objective is to demonstrate my proficiency in **data analysis using SQL** and **data visualization using Power BI**.

- Seats won by each political alliance and party
- State-wise and constituency-wise results
- Winning vs runner-up candidates and vote margins
- Alliance classification (`NDA`, `I.N.D.I.A`, `Other`)
- EVM vs Postal voting distribution
- Candidate-level vote performance metrics

SQL features demonstrated:
- `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `CASE`, `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `CTE`
- Update and transformation queries (`ALTER`, `UPDATE`)
- Aggregation and conditional logic
